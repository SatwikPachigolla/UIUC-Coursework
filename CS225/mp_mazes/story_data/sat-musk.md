It is 5 o'clock on a cool yet sunny evening. Elon Musk enters his garage to pick a ride to deliver him to his meeting with Stephen Hawking that he is running late for. He takes a few seconds to decide between his Ford Model T, Jaguar E Type Series 1 Roadster, and Tesla Model S P100D.

# sat-musk-models
Musk chooses his Tesla, putting his trust in his own company.

# sat-musk-jaguar
Musk's emotions overcome him and he chooses the Jaguar.
